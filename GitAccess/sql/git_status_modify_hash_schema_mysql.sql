-- git_status_modify_hash table
-- 
-- Used to log changes to page status (i.e. moving and deleting).
-- 
-- These aren't stored as edits and therefore can't be automatically
-- generated on-the-fly. These actions can't be generated from the
-- logging table because local commits could include multiple changes
-- and there is no way to mark these changes as being part of the same
-- commit. Also, Git stores a committer in addition to an author for
-- a commit. The same problems hold true for edits.
